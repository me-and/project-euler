A set of solutions to the [Project Euler][] problems.

**You probably shouldn't look at these until you've solved the problems
yourself.  I'm publishing these solutions in case other people _who have
already solved the problems_ are interested, and as a backup for my own record,
but to quote from [Project Euler's "About" page][About]:**

My solutions are (at least currently) all in Python 3, since that's currently
my go-to language for this sort of thing.  I make heavy use of iterators and
generators because (a) I think they're a really interesting and fun bit of
Python, and IMO one of the significant advantages of using Python, and (b) the
first language I learned in a formal setting was Haskell, and generators have a
pleasing lazy and functional feel to them.
