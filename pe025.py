1000-digit Fibonacci number

The Fibonacci sequence is defined by the recurrence relation:

    F_n = F_(n−1) + F_(n−2), where F_1 = 1 and F_2 = 1.

Hence the first 12 terms will be:

    F_1 = 1
    F_2 = 1
    F_3 = 2
    F_4 = 3
    F_5 = 5
    F_6 = 8
    F_7 = 13
    F_8 = 21
    F_9 = 34
    F_10 = 55
    F_11 = 89
    F_12 = 144

The 12th term, F12, is the first term to contain three digits.

What is the index of the first term in the Fibonacci sequence to contain 1000
digits?
